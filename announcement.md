# Introducing SHIFT - A New Era of Decentralized Social Media

We're excited to announce the upcoming alpha release of Shift, a revolutionary approach to decentralized social networking. This innovative platform aims to create a social network free from advertisements, censorship, and the constraints of traditional social media.

Shift offers a truly secure platform based on Storj a decentralized storage plattform.  
Our goal is to provide a platform that empowers users, respects their privacy, and promotes freedom of expression.

In addition, Shift introduces an exciting new concept: the Early Adoption Reward. EAR is a reward system for early adopters and pioneers on our platform. Users will have the opportunity to earn Liquid Micro Coins (LMC) by participating in the network, offering a unique benefit for those who join in the early stages of our platform.

As an early adopter, you'll have the opportunity to create LMC on a daily basis, offering a unique form of value exchange in our burgeoning platform. As Shift grows and evolves, the potential to earn and use LMC within the platform will expand.

What's more, with Shift you can start expressing your gratitude to others right away by giving LMC as a form of payment. You don't even need an internet connection or Bluetooth for transactions, its all done via QR-Code scanning. LMC has got a demurrage of 0.28 % / day and is strictly time based to avoid speculations.    
Our platform also encourages creativity and innovation, allowing users to create plugins that enhance the platform's functionality.

At Shift, we believe in the power of community and the potential of decentralized social media. We invite you to join us in this exciting new endeavor and become a pioneer in the future of social networking.

Keep in tough to join the Shift alpha release and earn your Early Adoption Reward (EAR).   
Let's shape the future of social media together!
