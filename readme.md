# SHIFT  
![logo](./images/logo.png "logo")  
The idea behind **SHIFT** is the possibily to create a social network without advertises, censorship and bullshit.
Also a universal basic income with a new virtual liquid made by men is created.  
The possibilities to have an own liquid to use as energy exchange, makes it easy for us all to share things, give services and to express our gratitude to other people.  
We will never be forced to pay taxes on it, because it's not money at all.  
It's just a virtual liquid.  
Also nobody can stop it, because it will run decentral.  

# GOAL
We are going to create a very simple app which the users can use to create new liquid on a daily base.   
We gave the name **LMC** to this new virtual liquid.  
LMC is the abreviation off **Liquid Micro Coins** and represents the gratitude and liquidity.

# RELEASE PHASES
## ONE
We are going to create a very simple app just to enable the user to scoop new liquid.  
You as the users can create about, lets say 10.000 ml (10l) of LMC every day. You can start the process in the app just cklicking a button.  
You can also invite your friend to join and if they do join you can earn 1.500 ml of LMC for every referred user per day.   
Every user can add up to 10 other friends.
If the referred users also refer other friends then you will earn additionally 300 ml LMC for each refered user.  
This will also happen if these user refer others and you will earn additionally 60 ml LMC for each refered user.  
You can make the math.  
Lets assume that you invite 10 friends and each of your friends also invite 10 friends and so on and all of them started scooping not longer than 24 hours ago.  
To make it clear. You only get benefits for inviting friends if they are actually scooping liquid.

| Level | Liter | Description |
|-|-|-|
|1|10 l|for you|  
|2|15 l|(10 x 1500 ml) for each friend |
|3|30 l|(100 x 300 ml) for each of the refered friends|
|4|60 l|(1000 x 60 ml) for each of the refered friends friend|

That would be 115 l each day. So will be able to pay people for their works for 115 minutes a day.  
All have to do is to spread the word about SHIFT and make it popular.

## TWO
When we reach, lets say, 1.000.000 users or when we will find enough people crowdfunding the development costs, we are going to develop a gratitude function in the app. Every user will then be able to show gratitude giving LMC from one app to the other. So the user is able to give the liquid which has been scooped to someone else. We call this **LMP Liquid Micro Payments**.  
At the moment its just me working on the app.  
The mark 1.000.000 will motivate some additonal developers to join in, because they see that the people want this app and the developers will be kind of payed with LMC instead of real money.

## THREE
There will be a **chat function**.  
There will also be a **micro blogging engine**, so that you are able to share things and services.    
We are not going to copy Whats App, Telegram or Facebook, because these apps where made with capitalism in mind (to earn a bunch of money), but we will implement similar functionality. Lets think about Facebook without advertising, censorship and collecting data of the users.  
Our data will not be used for selling or advertising.  
We dont even know who is behind the data, because the users dont have to register themselves.

## FOUR
There will be the possibility to implement plugins (Android Dynamic Feature), so that we all are able to create new content for a new **time shift**.  
One feature that I know already is to track empty houses, so that you can find them on a map and occupy them. 
Another feature is dating. So you can find musicians, likeminded people or even your soulmate.  
Maybe we can make automatic gratitute via LMP to musicians downloading their music.
All these feature are driven by YOU without the idea to make profit at all.

## FIVE 
After reaching the amount of 10.000.000 users the creation of liquid will be dropped down to 1.000 ml a day, so that all users are getting an equal amount per day without the amount of LMC for advertising. 
At that point we will cut the connection to the server and the platform will be running totally decentral and can not be stopped by legal forces.


# About the liquid
When we are talking about salaries and money, then we also talk about liquidity. So when you have got enough money you are liquid.  
In fact we don't wanne use money anymore, because in the old system as we knew it from before 2020, some people abused money to hort it. With this action they stopped the free flow of energy. So they created a blockade to keep much money for themselves. All other people where dryed out and had to suffer.  

With LMC all human beings will be equal. First of all we should think about gratitude for every hour. So when we do something for an hour for someone else, than this someone can show gratitude giving 60 ml (milli-liters) of LMC. So one ml per minute.  
So a softwaredeveloper in Norway will get 60 ml of LMC every hour and so does a hairdresser in India.  
Just fair ins'nt it.  

# Hiring Developer, Tester, Promoter, Designer and Influencer
If you are a developer, tester, promoter, designer and influencer and want to be part of the team and you are willing to accept LMC let me know.  
You will earn 60 l LMC per hour.  
- We are using Kotlin and Compose for the app. 
- Python and Flask for the WebService.
- Knowledge in DHT and P2P would be a plus.

# Inflation / Deflation
So that we will not flood the planet, the liquid will vaporate every day a small percentage until it's gone fully after 7 years. So it will be created, used and destroy in a full circle.

# Security / Integrity
The local database has been encrypted. So this makes it nearly impossible for someone to change any data in the local database. Which of course is also true for the balance.
When we are transfering LMC between two mobile phones, also the data will be encrypted. So this transer data can only be decrypted with the original app.

If you transfer an amount of LMC to a faked mobile app. It doesn't matter. The guy with the faked mobile app will not tell you that the transfer has been aborted, because otherwise you will find out that cheating is around.

If someone wants to transfer LMC to your account, then your app will not accept this transfer due to incorrect decrypted data.
