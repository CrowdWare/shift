The idea behind **SHIFT** is the possibily to create a social network without advertises, censorship and bullshit.  
At the heart of Shift is a unique value exchange system, which we also use as a reward system for early adopters and pioneers.  
By participating in the network, users have the opportunity to earn Liquid Micro Coins (LMC), our platform's virtual liquid.
The possibilities to have an own liquid to use as energy exchange, makes it easy for us all to share things, give services and to express our gratitude to other people.  
We will never be forced to pay taxes on it, because it's not money at all.  
It's just a virtual liquid.  
Also nobody can stop our network, because it will run decentral.  

# GOAL
We are going to create a very simple app which the users can use to create new liquid on a daily base.   
We gave the name **LMC** to this new virtual liquid.  
LMC is the abreviation of **Liquid Micro Coins** and represents the gratitude and liquidity.

# RELEASE PHASES
## ONE
We are going to create a very simple app to enable the user to scoop new liquid and a function to give gratitude (giving liquid to someone else).   
There is also the possibility to implement plugins (Android Dynamic Feature), so that we all are able to create new content for a new **time shift**.  
One feature that I know already is to track empty houses, so that you can find them on a map and occupy them. 
Another feature is dating. So you can find musicians, likeminded people or even your soulmate.  
Maybe we can make automatic gratitute via LMP to musicians downloading their music.
All these feature are driven by YOU without the idea to make profit at all.

You as the users can create about, lets say 10.000 ml (10l) of LMC every day. You can start the process in the app just cklicking a button.  
You can also invite your friend to join and if they do join you can earn 1.800 ml of LMC for every referred user per day.   
Every user can add other people.
If the referred users also refer other people then you will earn additionally 360 ml LMC for each refered user.  
This will also happen if these user refer others and you will earn additionally 75 ml LMC for each refered user.  
You can make the math.  
Lets assume that you invite 10 friends and each of your friends also invite 10 friends and so on and all of them started scooping not longer than 24 hours ago.  
To make it clear. You only get benefits for inviting friends if they are actually scooping liquid.  
That means the shift service has to run on your mobile and on their mobile.

| Level | Liter | Description |
|-|-|-|
|1|10 l|for you|  
|2|18 l|(10 x 1800 ml) for each friend (up to 10)|
|3|36 l|(100 x 360 ml) for each of the invited users (up to 100)|
|4|75 l|(1000 x 75 ml) for each of the invited user friends (up to 1000)|

That would be max 139 l each day in theory if everybody of these users are actually scooping. 
So you will be able to pay people for their work for 139 minutes a day.  
All you have to do is to spread the word about SHIFT and make it popular.

But lets be realistical. You invite 3 friends, they also invite 3 people and so on.
That would result in 10 l + 3 * 1.800 ml + 9 * 360 ml + 27 * 75 ml = 20 l  
That's not enough to be able to live from it, but if this app is running for about 1 month this will sum up to 660 l (worth 11 hours of work), and we have got a new currency. Also you are able to give services like massage, art, trainings etc and will earn additionally LMC.
Just imagine if we don't have to deal with these banksters and financial departments anymore!  
- No interest rates  
- No inflations  
- No price changes  
- No taxes 
- No waste of money for military 
- No more wars
- No slavery

In other words: **PEACE**, **FREEDOM**

We don't even need an internet connection to scoop liquid and to give gratitude.  
Transactions are made via QR-Code scans.
So there are no transactions traveling through the internet.
 
## TWO
When we reach 1.000.000 users, we will come to phase TWO.
At the moment there are just a few people working on the app.  
The mark 1.000.000 will motivate some additonal developers to join in, because they see that the people want this app and the developers will be kind of paid with LMC instead of real money.

There will be a **chat function**.  
There will also be a **micro blogging engine**, so that you are able to share things and services.    
We are not going to copy Whats App, Telegram or Facebook, because these apps where made with capitalism in mind (to earn a bunch of money), but we will implement similar functionality. Lets think about Facebook without advertising, censorship and collecting data of the users.  
Our data will not be used for selling or advertising.  
We dont even know who is behind the data, because the users dont have to register themselves.

## THREE
After reaching the amount of 10.000.000 users the creation of liquid will be dropped down to 12 l a day, so that all users are getting an equal amount per day without the amount of LMC for advertising.  
At that point we will cut the connection to the server and the platform will be running totally decentral and can not be stopped by legal forces.

# About the liquid
When we are talking about salaries and money, then we also talk about liquidity. So when you have got enough money you are liquid.  
In fact we don't wanne use money anymore, because in the old system as we knew it from before 2020, some people abused money to hort it. With this action they stopped the free flow of energy. So they created a blockade to keep much money for themselves. All other people where dryed out and had to suffer.  

With LMC all human beings will be equal. First of all we should think about gratitude for every hour. So when we do something for an hour for someone else, than this someone can show gratitude giving 60 l (liters) of LMC. So one liter per minute.  
So a softwaredeveloper in Norway will get 60 l of LMC every hour and so does a hairdresser in India.  
Just fair ins'nt it.  

# About the Shift service
When you start scooping in your app a service is started. A service on Android means that there is a program running even if you stop the app.  
Unlike all the services from google which are running hidden, our service leaves a notification on your mobile where you are able to stop it.
This service makes it possible to receive messages and forward them to the receiver. So your mobile becomes a server. You can compare it to bittorrent.
With this technology we are free of traditional servers where all our messages can be seens by the service provider. 
No one can stop the network, no one can censor our data, no one can pollute our network with ads.

# Hiring Developer, Tester, Promoter, Designer and Influencer
If you are a developer, tester, promoter, designer and influencer and want to be part of the team and you are willing to accept LMC let me know.  
You will earn 60 l LMC per hour.  
- We are using Kotlin and Compose for the app. 
- Python and Flask for the WebService.
- Knowledge in DHT and P2P would be a plus.

# Inflation / Deflation
So that we will not flood the planet, the liquid will vaporate every day a small percentage until it's gone fully after 7 years. So it will be created, used and destroy in a full circle.

# Security / Integrity
The local database has been encrypted. So this makes it nearly impossible for someone to change any data in the local database. Which of course is also true for the balance.
When we are transfering LMC between two mobile phones, also the data will be encrypted. So this transfer data can only be decrypted with the original app.

If you transfer an amount of LMC to a faked mobile app. It doesn't matter. The guy with the faked mobile app will not tell you that the transfer has been aborted, because otherwise you will find out that cheating is around.

If someone wants to transfer LMC to your account, then your app will not accept this transfer due to incorrect decrypted data.


# Forking
You might of course fork this repo for your need.  
But please keep in mind that if you would also deliver the same or a similar app it will not be compatible with our app because we are using API keys which are not public for security reasons.  So the users of your app will not be able to interact with users of our app.   

If you like to enhance this app instead then build a plugin and publish it to our users, so that they can install it.   

If you have ideas to change this app let us know, but we will not react on pull requests.
