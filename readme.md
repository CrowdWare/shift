# SHIFT  
![logo](./images/logo.png "logo")  
The idea behind **shift** is the possibily to create a universal basic income with a new virtual liquid made by men. The possibilities to have an own liquid to use as energy exchange, makes it easy for us all to share things, give services and to express our gratitude.  
We will never be forced to pay taxes on it, because it's not money at all.  
It's just a virtual liquid. 

# GOAL
We are going to create an app which the users can use to create new liquid on a daily base.   
We gave the name **LMC** to this new virtual liquid.  
LMC is based on Liquid Micro Coins and represents the gratitude.  

# RELEASE PHASES
## ONE
We are going to create a very simple app just to enable the user to scoop new liquid. The users are creating like 10 ml of LMC every day. They start the process in the app.  
The users can also refer other users and can earn 1 ml of LMC for every referred user per day. Every user can add up to 10 other users.

## TWO
When we reach 1.000.000 users or when we will find enough people crowdfunding the development costs, we are going to develop a gratitude function in the app. Every user will then be able to show gratitude giving LMC from one app to the other. So the user is able to give the liquid which has been created to someone else.  
The mark 1.000.000 will motivate some developers to join in, because they see that the people want this app and the devlopers will be kind of payed with LMC instead of money. 

## THREE
There will be a chat function.  
There will also be a micro blogging engine, so that you are able to share things and services.
We are not going to copy Whats App, Telegram or Facebook, because these apps where made with capitalism in mind (to earn a bunch of money), but we will implement similar functionality. Lets think about Facebook without advertising, censorship and collecting data of the users. 

## FOUR
There will be the possibility to implement plugins (Android Dynamic Feature), so that we all are able to create new content for a new **time shift**.  

## FIVE 
After reaching the amount of 10.000.000 users the creation of liquid will be dropped down to 10 ml a day, so that all users are getting an equal amount per day without the amount of LMC for advertising. 
At that point we will cut the connection to the server and the platform will running totally decentral.


# About the liquid
When we are talking about salaries and money, then we also talk about liquidity. So when you have got enough money you are liquid.  
In fact we don't wanne use money anymore, because in the old system as we knew it from before 2020, some people abused money to hort it. With this action they stopped the free flow of energy. So they created a blockade to keep much money for themselves. All other people where dryed out and had to suffer.  

With LMC all human beings will be equal. First of all we should think about gratitude for every hour. So when we do something for an hour for someone else, than this someone can show gratitude giving 60 ml (milli-liters) of LMC. So one ml per minute.  
So a softwaredeveloper in Norway will get 60 ml of LMC every hour and so does a hairdresser in India.  
Just fair ins'nt it.  

# Inflation / Deflation
So that we will not flood the planet, the liquid will vaporate every day a small percentage until it's gone fully after 7 years. So it will be created, used and destroy in a full circle.

# Security / Integrity
The local database has been encrypted with a 1024 bits key. So this makes it impossible for someone to change any data in the local database. Which of course is also true for the balance.
When we are transfering LMC between two mobile phones, also the data will be encrypted with this 128 bytes key. So this transer data can only be decrypted with the original app.

If you transfer an amount of LMC to a faked mobile app. It doesn't matter. The guy with the faked mobile app will not tell you that the transfer has been aborted.

If someone wants to transfer LMC to your account, then your app will not accept this transfer due to incorrect decrypted data.
