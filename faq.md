- How do you as a developer earn money with the project?  
You know, I am working as a freelance software developer since more than 35 years now. I also worked for the banksters in ZÃ¼rich (Switzerland) and erarned a bunch of money. 2014 I quit my well paid job and dedicated my skills to the open source software area. After I spent all my savings I had to request social money and was able to live with only a very small income. I also realized, after a near death experience, that we cannot die at all. That leads me to a journey, I made a few years ago, where I travelled Europa with my mobile home where I was able to survive from busking only. Then in the pandemic buskin was no option anymore (no people on the streets) I was able to live with just 50,- EUR a month. That time I lost my fat belly and a few months later I sold my first books. Today I am able to live from my books and when I am in Berlin I also collect social money, which enables me to keep my hardware updated. With this project I am also introducing an idea which I had at university 10 years ago, to fund open source projects via crowdfunding. So when I get fiat money via crowdfunding I will not only pay developers for there work, I will also get back my time investments for design, development and team management.
