# FAQ

- How do you as a developer earn money with the project?  
Some people might spent me a coffee [here](https://ko-fi.com/artanidos). You know, I am working as a freelance software developer since more than 35 years now. I also worked for the banksters in Zürich (Switzerland) and erarned a bunch of money. 2014 I quit my well paid job after a burnout with a near death experience and dedicated my skills to the open source software area. No more working for profit anymore. After I spent all my savings I had to request social money and was able to live with only a very small income. I also realized, after a near death experience, that we cannot die at all. That leads me to a journey, I made a few years ago, where I travelled Europa with my mobile home where I was able to survive from busking only. Then in the pandemic buskin was no option anymore (no people on the streets) I was able to live with just 50,- EUR a month. That time I lost my fat belly and a few months later I sold my first books. Today I am able to live from my books and when I am in Berlin I also collect social money, which enables me to keep my hardware updated. With this project I am also introducing an idea which I had at university 10 years ago, to fund open source projects via crowdfunding. So when I get fiat money via crowdfunding I will not only pay developers for there work, I will also get back my time investments for design, development and team management.  
- Will there be a version for iPhone?  
Yes possibly, but therefore we need Mac hardware to develop and test the app. Maybe after crowdfunding the project.  
- Can I exchange LMC against fiat money?  
Yes, if you find someone willig to exchange LMC against fiat money. One idea behind LMC is, hat it's based on time. So that the value will not change over the years and this also makes it impossible to use LMC as an object of speculations. We don't want make the same mistakes like most of the other crypto currencies out there. I would not give away LMC for fiat money, because fiat money is loosing worth every day, because they don't stop to print new money.  
- Why does LMC loose its worth over time?  
There was a man named Silvio Gesell who invented a demurrage to protect against inflation and horting the money. In 1932 the major in Wörgl (Austria) tried to create his [own money](https://github.com/CrowdWare/Shift/blob/main/schwundgeld.md) which uses a demurrage. I has been years of depression and bad economy. Using this new money he was able to pay workers and the workers where able to pay the in the shops and so on and so forth. He just borrowed this money because it disappears automatically after some years. The people spent the money immediatly to not loose worth and so it was flowing freely. We are adopting this technique. Would be nice if our governments also adopt this idea and pay it out as universal basic income one day. This reduces the cost to zero, because the money is flowing back to the issuer over time.
