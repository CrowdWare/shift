# Schwundgeld from "Das Wunder von Wörgl"

In "Das Wunder von Wörgl" (English: "The Miracle of Wörgl"), the term "Schwundgeld" refers to a local currency system implemented in the Austrian town of Wörgl during the Great Depression in the 1930s. It was created as a response to high unemployment and economic stagnation.
## Background

The mayor of Wörgl, Michael Unterguggenberger, sought to stimulate the local economy by introducing a complementary currency that would circulate alongside the national currency. The main feature of this currency was a built-in "demurrage" or "negative interest" system, which encouraged its rapid circulation.
## Functioning of Schwundgeld

Schwundgeld was designed to lose value gradually over time. Every month, holders of the currency had to purchase a stamp and affix it to the currency note to keep it valid. These stamps acted as a form of negative interest, as they effectively reduced the value of the currency.

For example, if someone held a Schwundgeld note worth 100 units at the beginning of the month and failed to purchase a stamp, the note would lose, say, 1% of its value. This penalty aimed to discourage hoarding and incentivize spending.
## Impact and Results

The implementation of Schwundgeld in Wörgl had a remarkable impact on the local economy. The rapid circulation of the currency increased business activity, reduced unemployment, and contributed to an overall improvement in living conditions. The town witnessed a surge in public works projects, infrastructure development, and a general sense of economic revival.
## Legacy

Although Schwundgeld was successful in Wörgl, it faced opposition from national authorities and was eventually declared illegal in Austria. Nonetheless, its brief existence and positive impact continue to be studied and referenced by proponents of complementary currencies, local economies, and alternative economic models.
