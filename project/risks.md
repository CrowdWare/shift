# Risks

| Risk | Solution |
| :-- | :-- |
| Big Brother can read feed | encrypt the feed |
| Big Brother knows the posters identity | no registration needed, so no private data will be stored about the user |
| DDOS attacks| No central server, many pubs or plain p2p, StorJ |
| Sybill attacks | can be ignored, because all human beings who use this app have got a good heart. The others are still using dollars and euros.|
| AI might use the app on a simulator| todo|
| User is able to install the app, spent 10 L on another app, deinstall and again 10L|Don't pay out 10 L on install|
| Check if we need to calculate a demurrage when paying | Should be ok, but we need a proof |
| StartScooping is public | Maybe we use the webservice for setscooping like before. Then we can check if client is valid. Or we call sell scooping tickets so that it doesn't make sense to run a desktop client 100 times. Another way is to check that a user has to invite at least 3 other users and only then he is allowed to scoop. Faked accounts will not have 3 invites. Running the webservice can also be used to sell tokens over Elopage.|
