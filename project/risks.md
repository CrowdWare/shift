# Risks

| Risk | Solution |
| :-- | :-- |
| Big Brother can read feed | encrypt the feed |
| Big Brother knows the posters identity | no registration needed, so no private data will be stored about the user |
| DDOS attacks| No central server, many pubs or plain p2p, StorJ |
| Sybill attacks | can be ignored, because all human beings who use this app have got a good heart. The others are still using dollars and euros.|
| AI might use the app on a simulator| People should meet in person to veryfiy the app, because the app is able to start scouping|
| User is able to install the app, spent 10 L on another app, deinstall and again 10L|Don't pay out 10 L on install. Only 1L|
| Check if we need to calculate a demurrage when paying | Should be ok, but we need a proof |
| StartScooping is public | We use the webservice for setscooping. Just scoop 1L a day plus additional for invitations. In order to scoop much LMC the account needs to have many peers invited and these many peers also need to scoop actively. So an attacker needs to invite 10 bots and these 10 bots needs to scoop actively. Also each account must be verified by other users to be activated.|
|Someone might steal my computer with secret data| Build the lib on the server to hide this data. Generate keys on the server and don't store them anywhere.|
