# Architecture

As the base we could use Scuttlebut infrastructure. This project already has got a few pubs available and the protocol is matured.

We might also use an own protocol if it makes sense.
We can combine a few techniques like storing videos on youtube or vimeo, pictures and feed on Diaspora, where we could use Diaspora for #searching also.
Locally we only store the key to our own account and those og our friends and friends of friends. So that data is limited. The latest posts and pictures can be chached of course.
