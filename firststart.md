# First Start
After starting the app you should read the message, depending on your mobile you might have to scroll down and then click the button.   
I just try to warn the users not to deinstall the app because of data loss.   

In order to get benefits from inviting friends you have to use an invitation code. If you don't have one yet you can use mine   
b5a79276-f3ea-4476-9e42-0861b3141948 
Thats the only reason for the next dialog. Just a name or nickname, the invite code and for us its important to see where you are located, so you have to select your country.  

# Start Scooping LMC (Liquid Micro Coins)
On the next screen you can spot the Gratitude screen. In order to start scooping LMC, just press the button. LMC is scooped even if you switch of the app, but you have to renew the scoop process every 20 hours. 

# Receiving a payment
In prder to receive a payment you have to press the receive button. Then you turn the handles of the clock (hours left, minutes right) to a specific amount and the total LMC will be calculated.  
The enter a purpose like "Massage", "Haircut" etc and press Continue.  

On the next screen a QR-Code as a proposal will be displayed to be scanned the giver.  

# Giving a payment  
When you are ask to scan the proposal from the receiver you just have to press the Give button, activate the camera and scan the QR-Code. Then the proposal will be displayed. If you accept press the [Continie] button. then another QR-Code is generated and displayed. At this point the amount of LMC is already booked from your account. To finalize the transaction just display teh QR-Code to the receiver at it scan.

# Final step
Now the receiver just has to press the [Scan Agreement] button to open the camera and scan the agreement.   
After this final step the amount of LMC is booked on the receivers side.

# Missing a step
While testing we encountert a little problem.
If the receiver does not scan the agreement, because he has just pressed the [Continue[] button.  
The transaction is not finally booked on his account.  
So we created a solution.  
On the main screen of the giver is a list of transactions. There should be at least one transaction with a negative amount. Just press the entry in the list and a dialog with a QR-Code opens. Now the receiver has to scan that code.  

If the receiver also closed the screen he just have to again press Receive, enter an amount and a purpose, a QR-Code is generated, which can be ignored and the user should press [Continue[] and then finally the camera opens after pressing [Scan Agreement] and the user is able to scan the code.

I know it might be a bit complicated but therefore we don't need an internet connection or Bluetooth at all.
